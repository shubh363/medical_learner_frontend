# Medical Subjects and Related Fields

## 1. Anatomy
The study of the structure of the human body, including gross anatomy (organs and tissues visible to the naked eye), microscopic anatomy (histology), and developmental anatomy (embryology). Anatomy is foundational for understanding all other medical sciences.

## 2. Physiology
Focuses on the normal functions of the body and its parts. It explains how organs and systems work individually and together to maintain life, including processes like respiration, circulation, digestion, and neural control.

## 3. Biochemistry
Explores the chemical processes and substances that occur within living organisms. It covers topics such as metabolism, enzymes, DNA/RNA, and the molecular basis of diseases.

## 4. Pathology
The study of disease, including its causes, development, and effects on the body. Pathology bridges basic science and clinical practice, helping to diagnose diseases through laboratory analysis of tissues and fluids.

## 5. Pharmacology
Examines drugs and their effects on the human body. It includes pharmacokinetics (how drugs move through the body), pharmacodynamics (how drugs affect the body), and therapeutics (the use of drugs to treat diseases).

## 6. Microbiology
The study of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Medical microbiology focuses on pathogens that cause human disease and the immune response to these organisms.

## 7. Forensic Medicine
Applies medical knowledge to legal issues, including determining causes of death, injury analysis, and toxicology. Forensic medicine is crucial in criminal investigations and legal proceedings.

## 8. Community Medicine (Public Health)
Focuses on the health of populations rather than individuals. It covers epidemiology, disease prevention, health promotion, and the organization of healthcare services.

## 9. Surgery
Involves operative procedures to treat diseases, injuries, or deformities. Surgery is divided into various specialties such as general surgery, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, and more.

## 10. Internal Medicine
Deals with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adult diseases. It covers a wide range of conditions affecting internal organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys.

## 11. Pediatrics
The branch of medicine dealing with the health and medical care of infants, children, and adolescents. It covers growth and development, childhood diseases, and preventive care.

## 12. Obstetrics and Gynecology
Focuses on women's reproductive health, including pregnancy, childbirth, and disorders of the female reproductive system.

## 13. Psychiatry
The study and treatment of mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Psychiatry combines medical, psychological, and social approaches to care.

## 14. Radiology
Uses imaging techniques such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI, and ultrasound to diagnose and sometimes treat diseases.

## 15. Dermatology
The study of skin, hair, and nail disorders. Dermatology covers both medical and surgical aspects of skin care.
